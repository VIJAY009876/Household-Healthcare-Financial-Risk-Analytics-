# Medical Expenditure Determinants and Prediction

A Streamlit-based analytics dashboard for studying the determinants of medical expenditure using the NSSO 80th Round Health Consumption Expenditure Survey (2022–23).

The project combines statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to analyze healthcare spending patterns, Catastrophic Health Expenditure (CHE), distress financing, and poverty impacts.

---

## Objectives

- Identify determinants of Out-of-Pocket Expenditure (OOPE)
- Analyze Catastrophic Health Expenditure (CHE)
- Examine distress financing due to healthcare costs
- Study poverty impacts resulting from medical expenditure
- Compare hospitalization and non-hospitalization expenditure patterns
- Build predictive machine learning models for healthcare financial outcomes

## Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VIJAY009876/Causes-Medical-Expenditure-.git
cd Causes-Medical-Expenditure-
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Prepare Data

Place your processed NSSO CSV files in `data/processed_data/`:
- `hospital_model.csv`
- `non_hospital_model.csv`

### 4. Train Models (Run Once)

```bash
python train_models.py
```

This script will:
- Train all 6 XGBoost models (CHE, Distress Financing, Poverty for both hospitalization types)
- Pre-fit all GLM statistical models
- Cache results to disk for fast page loads
- Generate feature importance files and performance metrics

### 5. Launch the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:8501/`

## Dashboard Features

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize OOPE, CHE, distress financing, and poverty across:
  - States and regions
  - Income quintiles
  - Hospital types (public/private)
  - Disease categories
  - Rural vs. urban sectors
  - Social groups and insurance coverage

### 📐 Statistical Analysis
- **Weighted GLM models** with population-representative estimates
- **OOPE models**: Gamma GLM for out-of-pocket expenditures
- **CHE models**: Logistic regression for catastrophic health expenditure
- **Poverty Line**: Impact models for poverty after OOPE
- **Distress Financing**: Models with odds ratios and confidence intervals
- Pre-fitted results cached on disk—no re-computation on page load

### 🤖 ML Prediction Engine
- Enter household characteristics to predict:
  - Probability of catastrophic health expenditure (CHE)
  - Risk of poverty after OOPE
  - Likelihood of distress financing
- Feature importance visualization
- Separate models for hospitalization and non-hospitalization cases

---

## Statistical Methodology

### Two-Part Model

#### Part 1: Weighted Logistic Regression (GLM Binomial)
Estimates the probability of incurring healthcare expenditure.

#### Part 2: Weighted Least Squares (WLS)
Models the logarithm of Out-of-Pocket Expenditure (OOPE) conditional on positive expenditure.

### Explanatory Variables

- Disease Category
- Hospital Type
- Economic Quintile
- Rural/Urban Sector
- Social Group
- Insurance Coverage
- Household Size
- Age and Gender

## Machine Learning Models

### XGBoost Models (6 Total)

**Hospitalization Cases:**
- CHE (Catastrophic Health Expenditure)
- Distress Financing
- Poverty Impact

**Non-Hospitalization Cases:**
- CHE (Catastrophic Health Expenditure)
- Distress Financing
- Poverty Impact
